<P>We now have all the major pieces needed to easily discuss and analyze object-relational mapping.  We have discussed object modeling and relational modeling.  We integrated the two models into a single object-extended relational model and described how to implement that model on current relational database systems.  Finally we discussed the issues with client-server object models.  
<P>Not all object-relational mapping products will be able to support the complete integrated model and all the client-server capabilities.  Some will choose a partial approach or simply not consider objects at all.  The best approach for mapping is up to each project and product vendor.  It will depend on how much of the integrated model they require, whether they can implement all the needed functionality, and the time &amp; cost considerations.   The following table identifies and describes levels of object-relational mapping sophistication from simply using the relational model up to implementing a full object mapping as described in this document.  At the end is a short description of the functional capabilities of an active object server.

<P>Use relational database model in the client and the server.  The client UI is organized around rows and tables and uses the standard relational operations to tables and rows.</TD>

<P>Have some use of objects on the client and try to isolate most of the application code from the specifics of SQL. Convert rows from the database into basic objects on the client.  Encapsulate hard-coded SQL calls within certain classes/methods so most of the application does not have to be coupled to them.</TD>

<P><B>Medium Object Mapping </B>
</TD><TD WIDTH=398 VALIGN=top >
<P>Primarily use objects on the client and write the entire application behavior in terms of these objects.  Application may have to manage transactions of these objects.  Flexibly convert rows from the database into the appropriate type of objects and maintain identity for these objects.  Manage associations between objects of variable types.  Allow retrieval queries to be specified in object model terms and then converted to the needed SQL calls.  Also allow simple identity based retrieval queries to be answered locally (without the database hit).</TD>

<P><B>Full Object Mapping </B>
</TD><TD WIDTH=398 VALIGN=top >
<P>Completely use objects in the application code.  As above but allow very general class data storage formats (for inheritance and composition), manage replicate vs. server state differences, allow queries to be completely executed locally when possible, combine multiple simple object queries into a single, larger database queries.</TD>

</TD><TD WIDTH=168 VALIGN=top >
<P><B>Object Server </B>
</TD><TD WIDTH=398 VALIGN=top >
<P>Server itself also uses objects to organize both the information and behavior, so retrievals and updates can be completely specified in terms of the object model and then executed on either the server or client as appropriate (for processing power vs. data movement).</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>Choosing a technique to use from among these levels will impact performance, cost, scalability, application behavior, development time, and maintenance.  No technique is best at all these criteria.  More sophisticated techniques are not appropriate for all applications and many applications work just fine with a purely relational model.  Other applications will grow to a size and complexity that is easier to manage using object models, and will have to decide which technique and products will best serve their needs.
