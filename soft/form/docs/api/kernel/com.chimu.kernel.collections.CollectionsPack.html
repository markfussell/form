Collections provides an interface-based set of collection classes.
Collection users are provided with the protocol for interaction with many different
(but related) types of collections, and they are only tied to those interface not
the specific implementation.  Collection implementations only need to conform to
the interface and can then choose what are the most important performance and
space criteria for them.  This also allows many interesting implementations like
Futures or Tracers to work within the same collection system.
<P>The main concept for the Collection framework is that clients should only be
concerned with the Type hierarchy when specifying functionality.  All
client-typing of objects (classes, methods, and variables) should be
done in terms of the type hierarchy.  Choosing among the implementations
of the types is only relevant at object creation time and should only need
to consider performance and code-base preference.
<P>Another concept within the Collection Framework is that the most commonly
used interface should have simple names.  Ideally Java would allow multiple
names for a single Type/Interface so we could have a Scientific long name
(Extensible Indexed Collection) and a more convenient short name (Sequence),
but since Java does not allow this we prefer the short name when it is very
natural.

<P>The Collection framework has precise definition of words which allows
collections to be self describing (in the long-name form).
<PRE>
Collection	An object which holds onto a number of other objects
Extensible	Able to add and remove objects
Updateable	Able to replace objects currently in the collection
Fixed	    Unable to change in state.  A FixedCollection is one that
cannot grow in size or replace any of its elements.  A client
can only ask questions of the collection.  In certain contexts
the Fixed is not as restrictive and allows replacement but not growth.
Keyed	    Having a key (Object) that can return a value
Indexed	    Having a sequential index number (zero based) that can return a value
Zero-based	Having an index value of '0' return the first value in an indexed
collection.  This is one of the many horrible Java concepts that
came from 'C' (for which it makes sense) and should be instantly
obliterated.  But barring that, all the collection classes are Zero
based for consistency with (most of) the rest of Java.

<PRE>
Array	    Indexed Collection (Non Extensible)
Bag	        An unordered collection for which an object can be added more than
once and the collection will remember each occurance.
KeyedArray	Indexed and Keyed Collection (Non Extensible)
Map	        Extensible Keyed Collection.  Can replace, add, or remove keyed entries
Sequence	Extensible Indexed Collection.  A collection where entries can be
added to the end or beginning and all members can be retrieved by
index (zero based)
Set	        An unordered collection for which an object can only be added once.
Subsequent additions of the same object are ignored.
</PRE>
<P>Portions of these collection classes were originally written by
Doug Lea (dl@cs.oswego.edu) and released into the public domain.
